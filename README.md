Still on the html/css frameworks, I have shocased the a great use the grid/flex-box display properties and the position relative/absolute amongst other normal css properties. For the video preview page, I have used the grid display property. The smallest screen will display a maximum of 2 video previews and the largest screen can stretch upto 4 video previews/ that's made possible by the @media property. I have used the flex-box property for the header and sidebars of the youtube clone. The header ofcourse has a higher z-index compared to anything else on the webpage. 

The webpage is not interactive at the moment but check it through
